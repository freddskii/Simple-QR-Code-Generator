# Simple-QR-Code-Generator
Creating a simple qr code generator using basic HTML and CSS

This project marks the beginning of my web development journey. 

Hi internet, i'm happy to announce that this simple qr code generator is my first project, and i would like to share my journey here. I'm using basic HTML and CSS to make this project, using a qr code generator API from GoQR. I'm also inspired by Nothing design, where the iconic pixelated text and bright orange color became their signature. I hope this journey won't end here, and for the next 30 days, i would like to do another simple javascript project to improve my skill.
